# Metrology for Kustom Live Wallpaper (KLWP) and Kustom Widgets (KWGT)

Metrology is a practical series of app customizations and redesigns aimed at bringing a bold, clear, and consistent user experience to [various Windows and Android apps](https://github.com/Madelena?tab=repositories&q=Metrology). Its design language is based on [Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)) and [Fluent](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/) design systems pioneered by Microsoft Design since the 2010s.

Transform your Android phone into a classic Windows Phone with a series of widgets and lock screens for Android based on Kustom KWGT and KWLP.
